CS-465 fullstack development with M.E.A.N.


Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?  
Express HTML is a frontend development framework for handling HTML.  It supplies and manages requests that are made with HTTP in order to service the client.  Javascript was the primary language that we used in the application, and it was used along side other frameworks such as Angular in order to define the behaviour of the application.  A single page application, like this one, is a dynamically updated webpage, as opposed to a multi page application, which deals with many different "pages," which are not dynamically changeable.  
I think that MongoDB is a good fit because of its flexibility, and ability to be worked into many different scenarios.  There are a lot of moving parts and frameworks in use in this application, and MongoDB is applicable with all of them.  

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
JSON is not a language, per se.  It's more like a formatting tool, where as javascript can make use of JSON in order to do its job.  The JSON is tied together with the frontend and backend through various API calls, serviced by the aforementioned frameworks in previous sections.  

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
The four most important and relveant HTTP methods include GET, PUT, POST, DELETE.  These are analgous to C.R.U.D. operations- the four core elements of data manipulation.  The API leverages these methods in order to facilitate interactions with the database as needed, such as when a user creates or updates an existing trip in the travlr app_admin service.  Security boils down to user authentication and encryption within this app.  We used a JSON web token or JWT to encrypt data with a key that we set ourselves, so as to verify the validity of a user's credentials as an admin or etc.  

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
All though I am certainly not a fan web development, I can confidently say that the various classes I've taken that use it as well as Mongo, SQL, and generally, database operations, have taught me a ton about how computers, applications, security, and the various structures of development work together.  I've learned a significant amount of how to follow best practices, as well as to communicate the ideas and needs of an application, to both a technical and non-technical audience.  At the beginning of my journey, all of these aforementioned things were foreign to me, and my closest experience was through game development.
